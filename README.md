**HOSA Medical Innovation Project**

Microsoft Azure based cloud server that securely allows for ECG data transmission from a physical wireless ECG built using an Arduino microcontroller. The website is a platform that displays vitals information 
(i.e. ECG reading, BP, O2 saturation) to enable more efficient transmission of information between paramedics and hospital emergency departments and reduce the time wasted summarizing/printing out vitals information once patients arrive at the ER.
